# Sales-mangement-system-for-farmers

### Problem statement:
In India, where there are many small farmers, the sale of farm produce ocuures in day to day basis. The shop keepers generally provide a bill containing all transactions at the end of the month. This bill which is mostly hand written, is difficult to store and retrieve in the long run. So by digitizing the bill, we allow the user to view their sales data easily and efficiently. This also creates the apportunity to create reports on sales based on crop, rate, month, shop, etc. 
With growth in user base we can begin recommending crops to sow, based on estimated prices. This will help empower the farmer to make the crucial decision of when, where and how to sell their valuable produce

### Technology used: 
PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL

### Learning
This project helped me to understand a problem from user perspective, plan use case analysis and to ask the right questions to develop a software product. I was able to use the knowledge gained from Database Management System course in college and this wonderfull book on php (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-php/9780596157739/), to integrate web applications and database management systems.
